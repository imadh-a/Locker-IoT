# Locker based IoT Model

## 1. Introduction
The IoT based project is focused on designing and developing a secure and innovative locker system that utilizes biometric authentication in the form of fingerprint recognition for access control. I built a prototype with a secure and innovative locker system that utilizes biometric authentication in the form of fingerprint recognition for access control
## 2. Methodology 
● The user will press ‘A’ to set a new pin and fingerprint or ‘B’ to enter the pin to open the door.
● If ‘A’ is pressed the user will be asked to enter a new pin.
● After the new pin has been received the user will be asked to give their fingerprint for
uploading the print.
● An id from 2 to 5 is asked from the user for giving a unique id for the user’s print.
● After verification and storing of the print, the user will be asked to enter the new
password.
● After the valid password has been entered they will be asked to keep their finger for
verification of fingerprint.
● If the fingerprint is valid then the LCD will display their id and name if any and the door
will be open.
● If the fingerprint is not valid then an error will be shown and the system will go back to
start.
● The door will be open for a limited amount of time and then it will automatically close.
● If ‘B’ is pressed the user will be directly asked to enter a valid pin and keep their finger
print.
● If any other invalid pin is entered then the LCD will display “WRONG PASSWORD”
and return to the start.
